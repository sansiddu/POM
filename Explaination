Explanation of the Code
This Java class is designed for BDD-style automated UI testing using Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber, TestNG, and Apache POI for Excel handling. The test reads data from an Excel file, performs UI validations, and writes results back to the Excel sheet.

Key Components
1. Class Level Variables
WebDriver driver: Manages browser interactions.
ProxyPage proxyPage: Represents the Page Object Model (POM) for UI interactions.
ExcelUtils excel: Utility class for handling Excel operations.
String filePath = "ProxyDataSheet.xlsx": Path to the Excel file containing test data.
2. Setup Method (@Before)
java
Copy
Edit
@Before
public void setUp() throws IOException {
    driver = new ChromeDriver();
    driver.get("URL_OF_THE_APPLICATION");
    proxyPage = new ProxyPage(driver);
    excel = new ExcelUtils(filePath);
}
Initializes ChromeDriver to open the browser.
Navigates to the application URL.
Instantiates ProxyPage for UI interaction.
Loads the Excel file for reading test data.
3. Test Data Provider (@DataProvider)
java
Copy
Edit
@DataProvider(name = "proxyTestData")
public Object[][] getTestData() throws IOException {
Fetches test data from ProxyDataSheet.xlsx to be used in the test.
Steps:
Load Excel file using ExcelUtils.
Read column headers from the first row and store column indices in a map.
Loop through each row:
Check if Skip column is 'N' (i.e., the test should run).
Retrieve the Proxy user column.
Store the test data in a Object[][] array.
4. Test Execution (@Test)
java
Copy
Edit
@Test(dataProvider = "proxyTestData")
public void executeProxyTests(int rowIndex, String proxyUser) throws IOException {
This test method runs once per data row from the Excel sheet.
It performs UI validation for each entry and writes results back to the Excel.
Steps:
Retrieve column names and indices from the header row.
Loop through all input columns (IN-*):
Extract the corresponding expected input value.
Call proxyPage.checkElement() to validate UI behavior.
If validation passes, write "Pass" to O-* column; otherwise, write "Fail".
Store a comment ("Validation successful" or "Validation failed") in the Comments column.
5. Save Results (@Then)
java
Copy
Edit
@Then("I save the results back to the excel file")
public void saveResults() throws IOException {
    excel.saveAndClose();
}
Saves all updates to the Excel file.
6. Cleanup (@After)
java
Copy
Edit
@After
public void tearDown() {
    driver.quit();
}
Closes the browser after test execution.
How It Works
âœ… Reads test data from Excel (only rows where Skip = 'N').
âœ… Executes UI validation based on IN-* column values.
âœ… Writes test results to the corresponding O-* column.
âœ… Adds a comment for validation status in Comments.
âœ… Saves the results and closes the browser.

Why This Approach?
âœ… Uses Page Object Model (POM) for UI interactions (separation of concerns).
âœ… Follows BDD with Cucumber (Given, When, Then).
âœ… Uses TestNG's @DataProvider for data-driven testing.
âœ… Handles dynamic columns from Excel, making it flexible for any UI validation.
âœ… Writes results back for easy reporting.

Next Steps
Implement ProxyPage (POM) to interact with the actual web elements.
Ensure ExcelUtils is correctly handling the reading/writing operations.
Would you like me to refine any part of the code or provide missing implementations? ðŸš€

Detailed Explanation of the Obtained Results
This Selenium TestNG framework reads input data from an Excel sheet, performs UI validations, and writes back the results to the same sheet. Below is an in-depth breakdown of what each part of the framework is doing and how the results are generated.

1. Execution Flow and Result Generation
Step 1: Reading Input Data from Excel
The ExcelUtils class reads the Excel file ProxyDataSheet.xlsx.
It extracts the header row to map column names to their respective indices.
It iterates over all rows and selects only those where "Skip" = 'N'.
The selected rows are fed into the test execution as TestNG DataProvider.
ðŸ‘‰ Expected Outcome: The test runs only for rows where "Skip" is 'N'.

Step 2: Performing UI Validation
The executeProxyTests method loops through IN- columns* (input fields).
It retrieves the expected values from the Excel sheet.
It calls proxyPage.checkElement(fieldName, expectedValue), which:
Locates the UI element by name attribute.
Compares its actual text with the expected value.
Returns true if they match; false otherwise.
ðŸ‘‰ Expected Outcome: The test checks if UI elements contain the expected values.

Step 3: Writing the Test Results Back to Excel
The corresponding O- columns* receive:
"Pass" if UI validation is successful.
"Fail" if it fails.
The "Comments" column stores:
"Validation successful" if the test passed.
"Validation failed" if the test failed.
ðŸ‘‰ Expected Outcome: The Excel sheet is updated with test results and comments.
