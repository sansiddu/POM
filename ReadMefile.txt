The Java code you've provided implements a Cucumber-based automation framework using Selenium and Apache POI for Excel handling. Here's a breakdown of each component, its purpose, and some suggestions for improvements or additional features you might consider.
Code Breakdown
Imports
The code uses multiple libraries:
Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) testing.
Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
Apache POI for reading and writing Excel files.
TestNG for data-driven testing via the @DataProvider annotation.
Class Structure
ProxyStepDefinitions
This class contains the Cucumber step definitions. It handles the setup and teardown of the Selenium WebDriver, reads input from an Excel file, executes the test cases, and writes the results back to the Excel file.
ProxyPage
This class encapsulates the functionality to interact with the web application, specifically checking whether a specified element matches an expected value.
ExcelUtils
A utility class for handling Excel operations, including reading data, writing results, and managing the workbook and sheet.
Key Methods
setUp(): Initializes the WebDriver and opens the target URL.
getTestData(): Reads data from the Excel file, filtering out rows marked to be skipped.
executeProxyTests(): Performs the validation for each test case and stores the results.
saveResults(): Saves the result of the tests back into the Excel file.
tearDown(): Closes the WebDriver.
Excel Handling
The ExcelUtils class is designed to manage Excel operations efficiently, including dynamic row and column handling based on a header.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Error Handling
Enhanced Exception Management: Currently, exceptions are caught but not logged. Consider adding a logging mechanism to capture errors to troubleshoot easily.
Graceful Failures: Provide more informative messages if an Excel file cannot be found or opened.
2. Configuration Management
External Configuration: Instead of hardcoding the file path and the URL, consider using a properties file or environment variables to manage configurations better. This increases flexibility and maintainability.
3. Test Reporting
Integration with Reporting Tools: Implement or integrate a reporting tool (like ExtentReports or Allure) to generate more comprehensive test reports, summarizing test results in a more structured format.
4. Parallel Execution
Enable Parallel Execution: If you have many test cases, consider enabling parallel execution to speed up the testing process.
5. Test Data Management
Dynamic Test Data: Consider adding functionality to read and write test data from other sources (like databases or JSON files) for more complex testing scenarios.
6. Browser Configuration
WebDriver Configuration: Allow for more configuration options (like headless mode, etc.) when initializing the WebDriver.
Conclusion
This code provides a solid foundation for automated testing using Selenium and Excel. By implementing some of the suggested improvements, you can enhance reliability, maintainability, and overall functionality. Happy coding, and best of luck with your automation endeavors!

    excel = new ExcelUtils(filePath);
    List<Object[]> testData = new ArrayList<>();
    Map<String, Integer> columnIndexMap = excel.getColumnIndexMap();

    for (int i = 1; i < excel.getRowCount(); i++) {
        if ("N".equalsIgnoreCase(excel.getCellData(i, columnIndexMap.get("Skip")))) {
            testData.add(new Object[]{i, excel.getCellData(i, columnIndexMap.get("Proxy"))});
        }
    }
    return testData.iterator();
}
Purpose: Provides test data for the test methods using TestNG's data provider functionality.
Actions:
Initializes ExcelUtils to read data from the specified Excel file.
Iterates through the rows in the Excel sheet, skipping any rows marked with "Y" in the "Skip" column.

Method: executeProxyTests()
java
@Test(dataProvider = "proxyTestData")
public void executeProxyTests(int rowIndex, String proxyUser) throws IOException {
    Map<String, Integer> columnIndexMap = excel.getColumnIndexMap();

    for (String columnName : columnIndexMap.keySet()) {
        if (columnName.startsWith("IN-")) {
            String outputColumn = "O-" + columnName.substring(3);
            String inputValue = excel.getCellData(rowIndex, columnIndexMap.get(columnName));
            boolean result = proxyPage.checkElement(columnName.substring(3), inputValue);
            results.put(outputColumn, result ? "Pass" : "Fail");
